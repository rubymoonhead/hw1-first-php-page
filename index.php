		<p>My name is Raya. My name is pronounced as <em>rah-yah</em>. The name <em>Raya</em> is of Hebrew origin and it means <em>friend</em>. I switched to a degree in Web Development from Nursing last Fall 2019. I'm glad I did because of my nerdy introvert personality.</p>
		<p>I'm an extremely private introvert. I'm an avid Windows/Xbox gamer. I love playing single player third-person games and, on occasion, play first-person games like <strong>Alien Isolation</strong>.</p>
		<p>I'm a voracious Audible reader. Currently, I'm listening to a fiction novel titled, <strong>The Pillars of the Earth</strong> by Ken Follett. It's an epic tale that involves four main characters and set against medieval 12th century England.</p>
		<p>I love to draw. I post new art every week on Instagram.</p>

			echo '<p>This assignment is challenging because I\'m applying PHP, a programming language I\'ve never used before. But while I\'m going through the process of completing this assignment, I\'m understanding PHP more. I feel good about that. The challenge is really using CSS because I still don\'t quite understand CSS.</p>';
